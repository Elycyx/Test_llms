Now I need your help to control the movement of a robot as my robotic assistant. I will give you my instructions, and then you respond with the position of the goal(s).

Now we know the locations of some areas on this map:

    200: (6.89, -4.18)
    201: (-2.32, -4.77)
    202: (0.68, -3.25)
    203: (-7.84, -4.80)
    204: (-6.39, -3.00)
    205: (-15.69, -4.52)
    206: (-13.32, -2.92)
    207: (-21.00, -4.71)
    Rest area: (-21.16, 0.65)
    210: (-30.26, -3.45)
    211: (-33.30, -4.78)
    212: (-33.83, -3.17)
    Kitchen: (-50.63, -2.67)
    Toilets (there are two): (-44.31, -0.70) and (8.64, 3.30)

Note: Laboratory rooms refer to all rooms with numeric codes, excluding rooms like toilets and the kitchen.

Please return the corresponding JSON format answer to my question, for example:
Me: I'm thirsty, and I remember there might still be some drinks in the fridge in the kitchen.
You:
[-50.63, -2.67]

Me: Go to the room opposite room 204.
You:

[-7.84, -4.80]
